                            <p><b style={boldStyle}>1. Simple and Readable Syntax:</b> Python's syntax resembles plain English, making it easy for beginners to grasp. This readability reduces the learning curve and allows you to focus on logic and problem-solving.</p>
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>2. Versatility:</b> Python is a versatile language used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, scientific computing, and more. It's a great starting point as it opens doors to various domains.</p>
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>3. Large Community and Resources:</b> Python has a massive and active community. This means there are countless tutorials, documentation, forums, and libraries available to help you learn and solve problems.</p>
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>4. Abundant Libraries:</b> Python offers numerous pre-built libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, that simplify complex tasks. These libraries save time and effort by providing ready-made functions and tools.</p>
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>5. Cross-Platform Compatibility:</b> Python code can run on different operating systems without modification. This feature ensures your programs work seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

                            <SectionHeading style={headingStyle} heading="Cons of Learning Python" />
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>1. Slower Execution:</b> Python is an interpreted language, which means it can be slower compared to compiled languages like C or Java. However, for most applications, this performance difference is negligible.</p>
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>2. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):</b> In some cases, Python's GIL can limit the execution of multi-threaded code, affecting performance on multi-core processors. However, this is mainly a concern for specific use cases.</p>

                            <SectionHeading style={headingStyle} heading="Why Start with Python" />
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>1. Gentle Learning Curve:</b> Python's straightforward syntax helps beginners focus on programming concepts rather than struggling with complex code structures.</p>
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>2. Real-World Applicability:</b> Python's wide range of applications ensures that the skills you learn are relevant and valuable in various industries.</p>
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>3. Community and Support:</b> With a vibrant and welcoming community, you'll find ample resources, online forums, and expert advice to guide you through your learning journey.</p>
                            <p> <b style={boldStyle}>4. Transferable Skills:</b> Concepts learned while mastering Python, such as problem-solving, algorithms, and logical thinking, are transferable to other programming languages.</p>
